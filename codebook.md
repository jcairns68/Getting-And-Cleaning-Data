###Getting and Cleaning Data: Creating a Tidy Data Set

The following is a list of all variables contained in the data set. The data has been aggregated
for each subject per each activity. Names are kept as is so as not to dilute meaning, as the writer did not fully 
understand each variable's meaning and did not want to misrepresent.
